                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a 30-year-old Latin American woman, 3<sup>rd</sup> generation Italian on my Father's side of the family, with a 
                    <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr> in <em>Architecture and Urban Planning</em>. <br>I moved from 
                    Brazil to Canada in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a struggle to settle in with all the lockdown 
                    restrictions, <br>especially career-wise. With a background in set design for theatre and cinema, I looked 
                    for jobs in the cultural industry, which was <br>incredibly difficult since the cultural sector was one of 
                    the most affected during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all the challenges of immigration and settling in professionally, I decided to pivot my career path and 
                    look for new opportunities. <br>Since a very early age, I've shown interest in creative activities. I love drawing, 
                    painting, building, sewing, and everything that involves designing. <br>Looking for a career that allowed me to 
                    give life to my visions and ideas encouraged me to enroll in the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program <br>at 
                    Algonquin College. The program's interdisciplinary approach compelled me, and I'm very excited about everything 
                    I've been learning.
                </p>
