                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a 30-year-old Latina, 2nd generation Italian on my Father's side of the family, with a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture and Urban Planning. <br>I moved from Brazil to Canada in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a struggle to settle in with all the lockdown restrictions, <br>especially career-wise. With a background in set design for theatre and cinema, I looked for jobs in the cultural industry, which was <br>incredibly difficult since the cultural sector was one of the most affected during the pandemic.</p>
                <p>With all the challenges of immigration and settling in professionally, I decided to pivot my career paths and look for new opportunities. <br>Since a very early age, I've shown interest in creative activities. I love drawing, painting, building, sewing, and everything that involves designing. <br>Looking for a career that allowed me to give life to my visions and ideas encouraged me to enroll in the Interactive Media Design program <br>at Algonquin College. I was compelled by the interdisciplinary approach of the program, <br>and I'm very excited about everything I've been learning.</p>
